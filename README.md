# DataTransmission

I'm trying stuff regarding data transmission. The stuff I do, doesn't really make sense... I am sending data from a pin from my arduino uno to another pin.
Rather than doing exactly what I am doing, it would make more sense to send the information from one pin to another pin from another board.

Meanwhile I am learning about bits and bit shifting...
